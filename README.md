## 🔑 Key Features (Explained)

1. **Real-Time Location Tracking**

   * Continuously monitors GPS/network signals.
   * Detects unsafe zones using historical and live risk data.
   * Provides instant alerts with location info for emergencies.

2. **Predictive Threat Analysis**

   * AI models analyze location, timing, and surroundings.
   * LLM interprets context (e.g., high-crime areas, unusual movement patterns).
   * Generates **risk scores** to prioritize alerts and user decisions.

3. **Emergency Notifications**

   * Alerts trusted contacts, and optionally authorities.
   * Supports SMS, email, and in-app notifications.
   * Includes location, risk level, and recommended actions.

4. **Intelligent Decision Making with LLMs**

   * LLMs provide context-aware safety suggestions.
   * Suggests safe routes, nearby safe locations, and preventive actions.
   * Learns user behavior for personalized recommendations.

5. **Modular & Scalable Architecture**

   * **Backend:** Handles AI/LLM models, API endpoints, data processing, database management.
   * **Frontend:** Displays live alerts, maps, and recommendations.
   * Separation enables **independent development, testing, and scalability**.

6. **Multi-Platform Compatibility**

   * Works on web frontends, mobile webviews, or native apps.
   * Easily extensible to frameworks like React, Vue, or native mobile apps.

## 🔄 Detailed Workflow

1. **User Registration & Setup**

   * Register account, configure trusted contacts, grant location access.

2. **Monitoring & Data Capture**

   * Backend collects real-time GPS, environmental, and user input data.

3. **AI & LLM Risk Analysis**

   * Data processed to calculate **risk scores**.
   * LLM interprets context and provides **actionable recommendations**.

4. **Alert Dispatching**

   * Alerts sent to user and contacts with **location, risk score, and suggestions**.

5. **Continuous Learning & Feedback Loop**

   * Logs events for AI/ML training.
   * Users can provide feedback to refine prediction accuracy.

**Example Alert Format:**

```
ALERT! 🚨 High-risk detected
Location: MG Road, Bangalore
Risk Score: 87%
Recommended Action: Move to nearest well-lit area & notify emergency contacts
```
